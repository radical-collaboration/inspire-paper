Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States ( accounting
for nearly 25\% of all deaths). Targeted kinase inhibitors play an
increasingly prominent role in the treatment of cancer and account for a
significant fraction of the \$37 billion U.S. market for oncology drugs in the
last decade. Unfortunately, the development of resistance limits the amount of
time patients derive benefits from their treatment.


The INSPIRE project is laying the foundations for the use of molecular
simulation and machine learning (ML) to guide precision cancer therapy, in
which therapy is tailored to provide maximum benefit to individual patients
based on genetic information about their particular cancer. It is vital that
such an approach is based on predictive methods as the vast majority of
clinically observed mutations are rare, rendersing catalog-building alone
insufficient.
